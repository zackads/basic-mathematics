    "    Therefore, $\\overline{PQ} = P + tM$ for all $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ by the analytic definition of a line segment.\n",
    "    We can re-write the definition of the line segment as a composition of a dilation by $t$ and a translation by $M$: $\\overline{PQ} = P + tM = (T_M \\circ D_t)(P)$ for $0 \\lt t \\leq 1$.\n",
    "    When we apply $F$, the translation by $A$, we have $T_A(\\overline{PQ}) = (T_A \\circ T_M \\circ D_t)(P)$ for $0 \\lt t \\leq 1$.\n",
    "    We know the composition of two translations is itself a translation by some point, let's call that $S$ such that $T_A \\circ T_M = T_S$.\n",

We see that this is in the form of the analytic definition of a line segment, and so the image under $F$ of $\\overline{PQ}$ is itself a line segment and the theorem is proved.\n",
    "    ii. **Ray**.  As the analytic definition of a ray is similar to the analytic definition of a line segment, but for $t \\geq 0$ instead of $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$, the argument in (i) applies: express the ray as a composition of mappings, apply $T_A$, consolidate the two outer transformations into one and find that the result is a ray by definition.\n",

    "    We could use the big idea from a previous chapter of translating everything to the origin, then reflecting in the origin, and then translating back again.  This would let us use the same proof as the previous two answers.  But instead, let's try unpacking the points into their constituent coordinates so we can  change the sign of the $y$-coordinate for the reflection.\n",
    "    Let $N$ be any point on the line segment $\\overline{PQ}$ with coordinates $(x, y)$.\n",
    "    Under reflection in the $x$-axis, $F(N) = N' = (x, -y)$.\n",
    "    So we can say that $\\overline{P, Q} = (P_x, P_y) + t(M_x, M_y)$.\n",
    "    And $F(\\overline(P, Q) = F((P_x, -P_y) + t(M_x, M_y)) = (P_x, -P_y) + t(M_x, -M_y)$. _(Uneasy about this -- I think this is a bit of a leap.  Does $F$ really have the distributive property over addition???)_\n",
    "    Again, we can see this is in the form of the sum of a point P with a dilated point M.  Therefore $F(\\overline(P, Q))$ is, by definition, a line segment. _(Again, relying very heavily on the logic of 'get it into the form of the definition'.
